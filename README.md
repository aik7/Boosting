# Boosting

We implemented both classification and regression algorithms using rectangular maximum agreement problem (RMA) as a subproblem.


## LPBR (LPBoost with RMA)

LPBR is a two-class classiffication algorithm using LPBoost and RMA.

## REPR (Rule-Enhanced Penalized Regression) 

REPR is a prediction algorithm using linear regression with both linear and boxed-based rule variables.
